### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

## What I Learned

During this project, I practiced CSS Flexbox and learned to use "auto" primarily for margins and padding in order to make the design responsive. These new skills have expanded my understanding of front-end development. I look forward to applying these techniques in future projects and continuing to grow as a developer.
